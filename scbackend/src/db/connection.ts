/**
 * connection.ts
 *
 * This file is responsible for managing all database-related setup.
 * In a full implementation, it would:
 *   - Initialize a connection to your database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
 *   - Create necessary tables or collections
 *   - Export the database instance so other parts of the app can use it
 *
 * For now, this is just a placeholder until the database layer is implemented.
