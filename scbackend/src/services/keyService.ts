/**
 * keyService.ts
 *
 * This service handles operations related to public keys used for verifying beacon signals.
 * In a full implementation, it would:
 *   - Retrieve stored public keys for specific beacons (from a database or trusted source)
 *   - Possibly register or update keys when a new beacon joins the system
 *   - Provide utility functions to check if a beacon is registered
 *
 * For now, this is just a placeholder until real key management is implemented.
 */

/**
 * Example function (stub)
 * -----------------------
 * In the future, this would query the database (via connection.ts) to retrieve
 * the registered public key for a specific beaconId.
